# Receipt-Maker
This is a small project showcasing how object oriented programming works. We use loops to illustrate how they retrieve data in an array of objects.

# Hint
A for-of loop works better than a for-in loop because it only retrieves the object and it's properties. On the other hand, the for-in loop retrieves the object, properties and prototype.
