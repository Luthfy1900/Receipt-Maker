# Receipt-Maker
This is a small project showcasing how object oriented programming works. We use loops to illustrate how they retrieve data in an array of objects.

# Hint
A for-of loops works better than a for-in loop because it only retrieves the data in the objects and for-in retrieves both the object and prototype.
